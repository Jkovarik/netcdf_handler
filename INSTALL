Installing the NetCDF server software and client library for DODS.

BUILDING THE SOFTWARE

1) Type `./configure' at the system prompt. On some systems you may have to
   type `sh configure.' If you want this part of the server to install
   someplace other than /usr/local/bin, use --prefix to change the prefix
   from the default "/use/local/." Make sure that the dap-server CGI knows
   where the handler is located (you can list the complete pathname in teh
   dap-server.rc file; see dap-server's INSTALL and README files).

2) Type `make' to build the three server programs

3) Install the server components in $prefix by running `make install.'

REQUIREMENTS

  o You need the libdap library to build and install this software. If you're
    using Linux, this means either building form source or using the libdap
    and libdap-devel RPM packages.

NOTES

  o For information about installing secure OPeNDAP servers, see the file
    SECURITY included with the dap-server software.

  o DEBUGGING AIDS

    - The OPeNDAP libdap library includes the following debugging aids that
      may be of help to you in developing new applications.

    - DBG: simple program instrumentation -- see the file debug.h distributed
      with libdap (which is installed in the libdap header directory; use
      'config-libdap --cflags' and look at the value if -I).

    - DBG2: more elaborate program instrumentation -- by convention this is
      used for output that is half a page or more, while DEBUG is used for
      single line output.

    - To build with program instrumentation use `--enable-debug=<level>'
      where <level> is 1 or 2.

    - By default, both debug and dbnew are *not* enabled. Thus, if you want
      to build a straight version of the libraries and test code, use
      `./configure'. If you want the extra features, use:

      ./configure --enable-dbnew --enable-debug=2
