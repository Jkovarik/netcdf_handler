	opendap.ini: Modified for my development machine. YMMV

2006-05-25  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Makefile.am: Changed the way libnc_module is linked so that on
	OS/X it does not require libnc_handler. This is OK on linux, but
	will be hard to handle for many admins should we be required to
	support an OS/X binary release.

2006-05-03  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	configure.ac: Now searches for the bes libraries and includes
	the netcdf module in the build if they are found. It's no longer
	necessary to use the --with-bes unless you have an odd setup.

2006-05-02  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

2006-02-03  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Added

2006-01-24  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Commented out the BuildRequires line in netcdf_handler.spec for
	libdap-devel 3.5.2 since I am building packages on my development
	machine and don't want to install packages there.

2006-01-24  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Modified netcdf_handler.cc so that it no longer calls any of the
	libdap iostreams methods (which have been removed from libdap).

2006-01-19  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Changed set_mime-test() in nc_handler.cc so that it uses stdout
	and not cout. I removed the iostreams versions of the
	set_mime...() function from libdap in version 3.6.

2006-01-17  Patrick West <pwest@ucar.edu>

	changed name of catalog from nc to catalog

2006-01-11  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Updated ChangeLog

2006-01-10  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Updated for version 3.5.2

2006-01-10  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Fix for ticket 281: int variables break the netcdf handler on
	64bit machines. The problem was in read(). In that method we test
	for the case where the variable is type NC_LONG (but NC_LONG is
	#defined to NC_INT!). In fact there are no 64 bit integers in
	NetCDF3. However, probably because the word 'long' was used, the
	type long was used to hold the result and thus the function
	nc_var_get_long() was called. On a 64bit machine that reads the
	C/C++ type 'long' which is a 64bit int while the data were 32bit
	ints.

	Rearrangement for automake.

2005-05-23  James Gallagher  <jimg@zoey.opendap.org>

	* .cdtproject, .project, Makefile.am, Makefile.in, acinclude.m4,
	config.guess, config.sub, configure.ac, depcomp, install-sh,
	missing, mkinstalldirs: 
	Added files missing from CVS and updated some of the build files. The
	make dist and distcheck targets now work.

	* version.h: Removed

	* Makefile.in, NEWS, TODO, config_nc.h.in, configure, nc_handler.cc:
	Rearrangement for automake.

	* configure.in: Removed

2004-07-09  James Gallagher  <jimg@comet.dods.org>

	* Merged with release-3-4-7FCS

2004-03-25  James Gallagher  <jimg@comet.dods.org>

	* Makefile.in: There was a persistent problem with the build
	failing because make thought it had to build netcdf.h (when it
	should be found in the DODS_ROOT/include dir). The fix was to
	rebuild the dependencies *after* building and installing in
	src/nc3-dods. 

2004-03-09  James Gallagher  <jimg@comet.dods.org>

	* This code no longer uses the Pix classes.

	* Translation of Structures is almost there. Missing is
	translation of the attributes.

	* Changed the implementation of the netCDF 2 interface. This
	software now uses the Unidata emulation code in v2i.c. See the
	README in lnetcdf.

2004-02-24  James Gallagher  <jimg@comet.dods.org>

	* Replaced the old version of ncdump with the version found in the
	3.5.1 distribution of netCDF from Unidata. Over time I'll migrate
	the entire code base to 3.5.1. This version of ncdump uses the
	netCDF 3.x interface which is where translation is currently
	supported. It will take a little extra time to back port it to the
	netCDF 2.x interface.

	* Check in of Reza's translation code. This version of the OPeNDAP
	netCDF CL can read from data sources that have Structures. Future
	versions will read Grids w/o the extra map vectors (i.e., the
	duplicates held outside the Grid) and Sequences (using a scheme
	Reza N and Joe W developed where an unconstrained Sequence has a
	default constraint of 100 elements).

2004-02-18  James Gallagher  <jimg@comet.dods.org>

	* Merged release-3-4-2FCS.

2004-02-16  James Gallagher  <jimg@comet.dods.org>

	* Bug fix: I added a declaration of nc_delete as extern "C". This
	was in response to a bug report on dods@unidata.ucar.edu. Look in
	lnetcdf/netcdf.h and Dnetcdf.h.

2003-12-08  Yuan Ho  <yuanho@ucar.edu>

        * Merge release-3-4 into trunk.

2003-05-02  James Gallagher  <jimg@dcz.dods.org>

	* Patch to the Fortran/fort-control.c file. This provides fixes
	needed to use the library with the new Fortran calls that are part
	of NetCDF 3.5. This is a temporary fix from Yuan Ho (Thanks!)
	until Reza can get the code completely switched over to 3.5

2003-09-08  James Gallagher  <jimg@dcz.dods.org>

	* I modified the read() method implementations so that they test
	the new in_selection property. If it is true, the methods will
	read values even if the send_p property is not true. This is so
	that variables used in the selection part of the CE, or as
	function arguments, will be read. See bug 657. (jimg)

	* Fixed char vs. byte and long vs. nclong error checks. (reza) 

	* Removed #pragma interface directives for the OS X. (rmorris)

	* Updated the servers to netCDF-3 and fixed error handling between
	client and server. (reza)

	* Added support for Cray multi-processor (CRAYMPP) interfaces,
	they use processor element 0 for all non-CrayMPP platforms. The
	Fortran interface needs them for a clean build. (reza)

	* Fixed unnecessary nc_sync() calls in netCDF code to improve NFS
	performance. (reza)
	
	* Win32 build changes (rmorris)

2003-04-28  James Gallagher  <jimg@dcz.dods.org>

	* Merged with release-3-3-1.

	* Linux build fixes; some changes were made to the Makefile.in
	files, esp in the Fortran bindings, and some generated files were
	removed from CVS so that they would not get included in the
	distributions or confused the nightly builds.

2003-04-23  James Gallagher  <jimg@dcz.dods.org>

	* The win32 build files were lost and added back into the code.

2003-01-27    <jimg@dcz.dods.org>

	* merged with release-3-2-8.

	* I removed tests for the Progress Indicator from the configure.in
	and configure scripts. Also removed was the libdap++-gui.a library
	and any use of it by the Makefile.in templates. Finally, the
	src/packages/libtcl and libtk directories were removed (from the
	cvs repository; they are in the src/packages/Attic directory).
	This removes all vestiges of the tcl/tk based progress indicator
	from our code.

	* Fixed call to Connect::request_dds(...). The local method
	request_Cdds(...) uses Connect's new version of request_dds(...).
	This file was 'fixed' once to use my first try at a new interface
	for Connect. I then fixed Connect some more and broke this code
	again... I think the current interface supported by Connect is
	much better.

	* Memory free errors found by Purity (pwest).

	* Memory leaks and a read error fixed (pwest).

	* Fixes for the IteratorAdapter.

	* Fixes to the Makefile.in.

	* Changes for gcc 3.2 build (which now works).

2002-12-16  Ethan Davis  <edavis@ucar.edu>

	* configure.in, configure, Makefile.in, ncdump/Makefile.in,
	nc_test/Makefile.in: removed all references to XTRALIBS, this
	function now handled by libcurl (curl-config script).

	* nc_test/Makefile.in (Repository): change use of 'm4' to '$M4'.

	* configure.in, configure: added setting of M4 environment variable.

2002-04-30    <jimg@dcz.dods.org>

	* Merged with release-3-2-7.

2002-04-25  Ethan Davis  <edavis@ucar.edu>

	* Makefile.in: remove config.status dependency in Makefile
	target.

2002-04-17    <jimg@dcz.dods.org>

	* nc_test/nc_test.c (NC_TEST): Now uses ** instead of *** for tests.

	* Dnc.cc (ncopen): Fixed bug 393.

	* lnetcdf/lv2i.c (NCadvise): Fixed garbled messages.

2001-10-13  James Gallagher  <jimg@dcz.dods.org>

	* Minor fixes to configure.

	* Updated INSTALL & README.

2001-09-28  James Gallagher  <jimg@dcz.dods.org>

2001-09-26  James Gallagher  <jimg@dcz.dods.org>

	* Added version support (Reza).

2001-08-30  James Gallagher  <jimg@dcz.dods.org>

	release-3-2. 

2001-08-30  James Gallagher  <jimg@dcz.dods.org>

	* Fix for bug #202: The client library now checks for incoming
	Error objects. (From Reza)

	* Fix for bug #217: The tests now work; the problem was in the code
	that runs the tests and/or sets up the test dataset. (From Reza)

	* Fix for bugs #71 and #90: An Error object is now returned when
	a URL references a dataset that does not exist. (from Reza)

2001-06-19  James Gallagher  <jimg@dcz.dods.org>

	* Merged with release-3-2 head (tagged release-3-2-3). The next
	merge should use update -j release-3-2-3 -j release-3-2.

	* Moved most of the code in main() inside the try block (for all
	three handlers).

	* Cleaned up for switch from nph-* to nph-dods. (ethan)

	* Fixed tar and binary-tar targets. (ethan)

	* Paths are now relative where possible

	* Fixed exception handlers to return correct error codes. (reza)

2000-12-06  James Gallagher  <jimg@dcz.dods.org>

	* Fixed the build (removed nph-nc install, etc.)

2000-01-27  James Gallagher  <jimg@dcz.dods.org>

	-j release-3-1-2 -j release-3-1.

	* Removed extraneous files.

	* Fixed the build on little-endian machines.

1999-11-04  James Gallagher  <jimg@dcz.dods.org>

	* Merged: botched cvs but the next merge should use -j
	release-3-1-1 -j release-3-1.

	* Added info about header files.  Also updated some URLs (Ethan).

	* Removed incompatibilities in error handling and added support
	for scalar types (Reza).

	* Fixed: Reza fixed the IMAP bug.

1999-08-17  James Gallagher  <jimg@dcz.dods.org>

	* This code now supports the netCDF 3.x library.

1999-05-07  James Gallagher  <jimg@dcz.dods.org>

	* String-->string

1999-05-05  James Gallagher  <jimg@dcz.dods.org>

	* Added test-coverage target to Makefile.in

1999-01-21  James Gallagher  <jimg@dcz.cvo.oneworld.com>

	* The server now registers the file name properly. This ensures
	that the new projection functions can call the read() member
	function and not fail.

1998-11-11  James Gallagher  <jimg@dcz.cvo.oneworld.com>

	* Fixed a resource leak when working with local files.
