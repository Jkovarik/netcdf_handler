2003-04-28  James Gallagher  <jimg@dcz.dods.org>

	* Merged with release-3-3-1.

	* Linux build fixes; some changes were made to the Makefile.in
	files, esp in the Fortran bindings, and some generated files were
	removed from CVS so that they would not get included in the
	distributions or confused the nightly builds.

2003-04-23  James Gallagher  <jimg@dcz.dods.org>

	* The win32 build files were lost and added back into the code.

2003-01-27    <jimg@dcz.dods.org>

	* merged with release-3-2-8.

	* I removed tests for the Progress Indicator from the configure.in
	and configure scripts. Also removed was the libdap++-gui.a library
	and any use of it by the Makefile.in templates. Finally, the
	src/packages/libtcl and libtk directories were removed (from the
	cvs repository; they are in the src/packages/Attic directory).
	This removes all vestiges of the tcl/tk based progress indicator
	from our code.

	* Fixed call to Connect::request_dds(...). The local method
	request_Cdds(...) uses Connect's new version of request_dds(...).
	This file was 'fixed' once to use my first try at a new interface
	for Connect. I then fixed Connect some more and broke this code
	again... I think the current interface supported by Connect is
	much better.

	* Memory free errors found by Purity (pwest).

	* Memory leaks and a read error fixed (pwest).

	* Fixes for the IteratorAdapter.

	* Fixes to the Makefile.in.

	* Changes for gcc 3.2 build (which now works).

2002-12-16  Ethan Davis  <edavis@ucar.edu>

	* configure.in, configure, Makefile.in, ncdump/Makefile.in,
	nc_test/Makefile.in: removed all references to XTRALIBS, this
	function now handled by libcurl (curl-config script).

	* nc_test/Makefile.in (Repository): change use of 'm4' to '$M4'.

	* configure.in, configure: added setting of M4 environment variable.

2002-04-30    <jimg@dcz.dods.org>

	* Merged with release-3-2-7.

2002-04-25  Ethan Davis  <edavis@ucar.edu>

	* Makefile.in: remove config.status dependency in Makefile
	target.

2002-04-17    <jimg@dcz.dods.org>

	* nc_test/nc_test.c (NC_TEST): Now uses ** instead of *** for tests.

	* Dnc.cc (ncopen): Fixed bug 393.

	* Fix for bug #202: The client library now checks for incoming
	Error objects. (From Reza)

	* Fix for bug #217: The tests now work; the problem was in the code
	that runs the tests and/or sets up the test dataset. (From Reza)

	* Fix for bugs #71 and #90: An Error object is now returned when
	a URL references a dataset that does not exist. (from Reza)

2001-06-19  James Gallagher  <jimg@dcz.dods.org>

	* Merged with release-3-2 head (tagged release-3-2-3). The next
	merge should use update -j release-3-2-3 -j release-3-2.

	* Moved most of the code in main() inside the try block (for all
	three handlers).

	* Cleaned up for switch from nph-* to nph-dods. (ethan)

	* Added test-coverage target to Makefile.in

1999-01-21  James Gallagher  <jimg@dcz.cvo.oneworld.com>

	* The server now registers the file name properly. This ensures
	that the new projection functions can call the read() member
	function and not fail.

1998-11-11  James Gallagher  <jimg@dcz.cvo.oneworld.com>
