Updated for version 3.5.0

Removed the libnc-dods software. The OPeNDAP-netCDF client library is now
in a separate CVS module named libnc-dap. 

This software now uses automake and a modern autoconf.

This code now builds with gcc 3.2 in addition to VC++ and gcc 2.95.3.

The software has been changed to work with DAP 3.3.

The configure script requires autoconf 2.13, even though the rest of the
DODS/NVODS software using autocond 2.53. This is because the UD macros from
Unidata don't work with the newer autoconf. I understand that they will soon
enough...
