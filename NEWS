Version 3.6.0

This version of the netcdf handler builds with libdap 3.6.0.

Patrice Dumas has contributed improvements to the spec file used to build the
RPM packages.

Misc. fixes for the handler when used with Server4 (which is in development).

Version 3.5.2

Fix for ticket 281: int variable break on 64 bit machines. The fix involved
using nc_var_get_int() in place of nc_var_get_long in NCArray::read() and
using NC_INT in place of NC_LONG in read's switch statement.

Version 3.5.1

Bug fix: The handler did not process arrays of bytes correctly.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

The handler now works with the new dap server configuration.

Removed the libnc-dods software. The OPeNDAP-netCDF client library is now
in a separate CVS module named libnc-dap. 

This software now uses automake and a modern autoconf.

This code now builds with gcc 3.2 in addition to VC++ and gcc 2.95.3.

The software has been changed to work with DAP 3.3.

The configure script requires autoconf 2.13, even though the rest of the
DODS/NVODS software using autocond 2.53. This is because the UD macros from
Unidata don't work with the newer autoconf. I understand that they will soon
enough...
