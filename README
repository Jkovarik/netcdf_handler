Updated for version 3.9.3

This is the OPeNDAP netCDF Data Handler. It is used along with Hyrax.

For information about building the OPeNDAP netCDF Data Handler, see the
INSTALL file.

This data handler is a component of the OPeNDAP DAP Server; the server base
software is designed to allow any number of handlers to be configured easily.
See the DAP Server README and INSTALL files for information about
configuration, including how to use this handler.

This version of the handler has been tested with netcdf 4 API files (not
netcdf 4 data model files). It works with netcdf 4 API NC_CLASSIC_MODEL files
that are either plain or compressed. To get this feature you must link the 
handler to a copy of the netcdf 4 API library that has been built with HDF5.
Teh INSTALL file has more details. 

Note: Netcdf3 and NetCDF4 define the following:
NC_BYTE         8-bit signed integer
NC_CHAR         8-bit unsigned integer
NC_SHORT        16-bit signed integer
NC_USHORT       16-bit unsigned integer *
NC_INT (or NC_LONG)     32-bit signed integer
NC_UINT         32-bit unsigned integer *
NC_INT64        64-bit signed integer *
NC_UINT64       64-bit unsigned integer *
NC_FLOAT        32-bit floating point
NC_DOUBLE       64-bit floating point
NC_STRING       variable length character string * 

And DAP defines cardinals using the same bit-widths. This handler assumes this
when it reads data.

Special options supported by the handler: 
* ShowSharedDimensions: Include shared dimensions as separate variables. 
Accepted values: true,yes|false,no, defaults to false.
Example: "NC.ShowSharedDimensions=false"

Test data are also installed, so after installing this handler, Hyrax 
will have data to serve providing an easy way to test your new installation
and to see how a working bes.conf should look. To use this, make sure
that you first install the bes, and that dap-server gets installed too.
Finally, every time you install or reinstall handlers, make sure to restart
the BES and OLFS.
