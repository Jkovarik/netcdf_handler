This is the OPeNDAP netCDF Data Handler. It is used along with the OPeNDAP
DAP Server3 and Hyrax 1.02 beta.

For information about building the OPeNDAP netCDF Data Handler, see the
INSTALL file.

This data handler is a component of the OPeNDAP DAP Server; the server base
software is designed to allow any number of handlers to be configured easily.
See the DAP Server README and INSTALL files for information about
configuration, including how to use this handler.

Now this handler includes automatic configuration of the handler using 'make
install.' Now the handler is automatically configured in the bes.conf file in
the default location. Test data are also installed, so after installing this
handler Hyrax will have data to serve providing an easy way to test your new
install and to see how a working bes.conf should look. To use this, make sure
that you first install the bes, and that dap-server gets installed too.
Finally, every time you install or reinstall handlers, make sure to restart
the BES and OLFS.
