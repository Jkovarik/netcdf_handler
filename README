Updated for version 3.8.3 (9 June 2009)

This is the OPeNDAP netCDF Data Handler. It is used along with the OPeNDAP
DAP Server3 and Hyrax.

For information about building the OPeNDAP netCDF Data Handler, see the
INSTALL file.

This data handler is a component of the OPeNDAP DAP Server; the server base
software is designed to allow any number of handlers to be configured easily.
See the DAP Server README and INSTALL files for information about
configuration, including how to use this handler.

Special options supported by the handler: 
* ShowSharedDimensions: Include shared dimensions as separate variables. 
Accepted values: true,yes|false,no, defaults to false.
Example: "NC.ShowSharedDimensions=false"

A configuration edition helper script, `bes-nc-data.sh' is provided in this 
package for easy configuration of the Hyrax BES server, designed to edit
bes.conf. The script is called using:

<code>
   bes-nc-data.sh [<bes.conf file to modify> [<bes modules dir>]]
</code>
   
The `bes-conf' make target runs the script while trying to select paths 
cleverly, and should be called using:

<code>
   make bes-conf
</code>

Test data are also installed, so after installing this handler, Hyrax 
will have data to serve providing an easy way to test your new installation
and to see how a working bes.conf should look. To use this, make sure
that you first install the bes, and that dap-server gets installed too.
Finally, every time you install or reinstall handlers, make sure to restart
the BES and OLFS.
